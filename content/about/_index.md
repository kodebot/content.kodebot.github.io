### Hello fellow developer :wave:
Thank you for visiting this page.

There is nothing special about me to highlight here. I am a software developer just like you. I am developing software professionally for about 16 years now.

I live in Leeds, UK and work for companies that are commutable from Leeds. 

Most of the posts I write here are simply a knowledge dump for future me. I write posts here in one of the following styles based on my experience from my day job or side projects
* What is it?
* How do I do it?
* How do I fix it?

Hopefully you find it useful.
