### What is tmux?
`tmux` is terminal multiplexer that allows your terminal to be split into different sessions, windows and panes. One of the great thing about `tmux` session is that it allows you to detach and reattach to the sessions with terminating the programs running in the sessions.


**Session** - is a wrapper for your windows and panes that you can create, detach from and reattach to without terminating the programs running in the sessions

{{% notice warning %}}
It is obvious but just so it is clear, you will lose the sessions and programs running in those sessions on reboot.
{{% /notice %}}

**Window** - is like tabs within a session, you can switch between them but you can only see one window at a time by default

**Pane** - is a region in the window. By default each with comes with 1 pane. You can add additional horizontal and/or vertical panes as you like
