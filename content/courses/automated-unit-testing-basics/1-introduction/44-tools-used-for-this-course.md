We use C# with .NET Core for this course but the concepts we are going to look at remains same for any similar language/platform.

The tools we are using for this course are

1. Visual Studio 2017 - IDE
2. xUnit.NET - Unit testing framework
3. Moq - Mocking library

You will find equivalent tools for any language/platform you choose.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
This is a tool used for development. IDE usually make developer life easy by offering range of options from intellisense/code completion to building and deploying your code.

## Unit testing framework
A unit testing framework removes the boilerplate needed to write and run automated unit tests. Usually this integrates with your IDE so you can run you tests straight from your IDE.

## Mocking library
Mocking library helps us to build test doubles quickly and easily. They also offer various options to verify the result of our tests. We will go into the details of mocking library in the future chapter.



* state verification and result verification

This type of code can be
* collaborate (collaborating objects)
* delegate 

This type of code is very common object oriented design.
