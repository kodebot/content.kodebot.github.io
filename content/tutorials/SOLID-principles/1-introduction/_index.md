SOLID is mnemonic acronym. Each letter represents one principle.

The principles were first introduced by Robert C. Martin but the acronym was later introduced by Micheal Feathers.

The following are the principles that are part of SOLID principles

* [Single Responsibility Principle](../2-single-responsibility-principle/)
* [Open Closed Principle](../3-open-closed-principle)
* [Liskov Substitution Principle](../4-liskov-substitution-principle)
* [Interface Segregation Principle](../5-interface-segregation-principle)
* [Dependency Inversion Principle](../6-dependency-inversion-principle)

When designing software using object oriented methodology, the SOLID principles help to keep the design readable, flexible and maintainable.

In the upcoming chapters, we cover each of these principles in details with example for code that violates these principle and refactored code that confirms to these principles.
