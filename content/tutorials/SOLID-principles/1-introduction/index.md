SOLID is mnemonic acronym where each letter represents one principle.

The principles were first introduced by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) but the acronym was later introduced by Michael Feathers.

The following are the principles that makes up SOLID

* [Single Responsibility Principle](../2-single-responsibility-principle/)
* [Open-Closed Principle](../3-open-closed-principle)
* [Liskov Substitution Principle](../4-liskov-substitution-principle)
* [Interface Segregation Principle](../5-interface-segregation-principle)
* [Dependency Inversion Principle](../6-dependency-inversion-principle)

When designing software using object oriented methodology, the SOLID principles help to keep the design readable, flexible and maintainable.

In the upcoming chapters, we cover each of these principles in detail with example code that violates the principle and refactored code that confirms to the principle.
