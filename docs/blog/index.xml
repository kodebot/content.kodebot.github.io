      <description>I have used inheritance to solve a problem in many situations - some of them are correct and some of them are not when thinking about it now.
 When you are in a situation where you think you need multi-level inheritance, 9 out of 10 times you can solve the same problem using decorators.
 One of the problems I have seen recently which fits in this pattern is the implementation of ICommand interface.</description>

      <title>Setup Chutzpah to Run Javascript Tests in VisualStudio</title>

      <description>First thing first, install Chutzpah Test Runner&amp;nbsp;and Test Adaptor for the Test Explorer.
Next, setup your projects in Visual Studio. I personally like to keep my test code in a separate project for JavaScript as well so my project and folder structure looks like this:
&amp;nbsp;This allows you&amp;nbsp;to restrict testing frameworks and libraries like Jasmine only to&amp;nbsp;the test project. I use JavaScript&amp;nbsp;libraries directly from the main project when it is needed in test projects as well rather then adding them again in the test project (some people have different view on this but it works for me).</description>
