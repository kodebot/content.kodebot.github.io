      <description>I have used inheritance to solve a problem in many situations - some of them are correct and some of them are not when thinking about it now.
 When you are in a situation where you think you need multi-level inheritance, 9 out of 10 times you can solve the same problem using decorators.
 One of the problems I have seen recently which fits in this pattern is the implementation of ICommand interface.</description>
