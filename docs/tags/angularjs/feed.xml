      <title>AngularJS 1.x - Validation on File Input type</title>

      <description>Introduction You might already known that AngularJS 1.x doesn’t support model binding for File Input type at the moment. This means, implementing any validation on File Input type is not straight forward as validation entirely depends on model binding.
I have come across a requirement where, I need to create a form with ‘required’ validation on File Input type and I also need to display bootstrap form feedback. There are number of great solutions out there to make file upload with angular easier but none of them provide easier way to enforce validation.</description>

      <title>Angular 1.x - Unit Testing a function that returns Promise</title>

      <description>I wrote this post few months back which show how we can mock a function that returns Promise. In this post, we will see how to test a function that returns Promise.
We will use the following simple controller as our SUT
var app = angular.module(&amp;#34;app&amp;#34;); app.controller(&amp;#34;studentController&amp;#34;, function($q, studentDataService){ var vm = this; vm.students = undefined; activate(); function activate (){ vm.students = getAllStudents(); } function getAllStudents(){ return studentDataService .getAll(); } });  This simple controller has getAllStudents() which returns a promise.</description>

      <title>TypeScript - &#39;this&#39; reference in AngularJS event handler</title>

      <description>Let&#39;s have a look at how AngularJS 1.x controller is usually created in TypeScript before we go into details of how AngularJS event handler and how &#39;this&#39; works in the AngularJS event handler context. TypeScript encourages to type anything and everything to take full advantages of the type system and tool supports we get when working with any strongly typed language.
So, when using TypeScript with AngularJS 1.x, class is usually created to represent the implementation of the controllers.</description>

      <description>In part 1&amp;nbsp;and 2&amp;nbsp;of this series, we have seen five different ways to create a service in angular.
The last one we are going to look at in this series is &#39;decorate&#39; function of $provide service.
Decorator The decorate function is NOT used to create a service, instead, this is used to decorate or replace an existing service. Let&#39;s look at this function with an example
// sample 1 app.factory(&amp;#39;movieService&amp;#39;, movieService); function movieService() { return { getAllMovies: getAllMovies } function getAllMovies() { return [&amp;#39;engMovie1&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;engMovie2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;engMovie3&amp;#39;]; } }  In this example, we have movieService which exposes a function to get all the movies.</description>

      <description>In part 1&amp;nbsp;of this series, we have briefly seen how $provide and $injector work and we also took a deep dive on how we create a service using provider function of $provide service.
Lets continue our journey and look at how and when we can&amp;nbsp;use other&amp;nbsp;functions of $provide service to create services.
The following are the four&amp;nbsp;functions we are going to look at now
 factory service value constant  Factory The factory is one of the functions exposed by $provide service to create services.</description>

      <description>Introduction Services are one of the core buiding blocks of AngularJS. It helps us to create reusable code that can be shared accross the application(s).
AngularJS gives us five different options to create services. We will look at what are those five options and how and when they can be used. But, before that lets take a brief look at couple of built-in angular services and how they works in the context of dependency injection.</description>

      <description>Promises are very useful to develope non-blocking web applications and it also helps to avoid pyramid of doom.
AngularJS supports&amp;nbsp;Q&amp;nbsp;based promises, this means, we can create functions in AngularJS application that uses promises. When it comes to unit testing functions that returns promises, it is just like unit testing normal functions only if you remember&amp;nbsp;simulate scope&#39;s life cycle using $apply() or $digest()
Let&#39;s see this with an example. The following controller loads restaurants using promise</description>

      <title>Organize AngularJS Tests within a test file</title>

      <description>I like to have one test file&amp;nbsp;per components of AngularJS application. So, for example, homeController will have its own test file&amp;nbsp;named homeSpec or homeControllerSpec.
First, create a&amp;nbsp;suite to describe a component at a high level and for each scenario create&amp;nbsp;nested suits. This allows us&amp;nbsp;to define any test setup that are common for all the tests&amp;nbsp;in one place.
For example, loading module, overriding and injecting any dependencies are done in the beforeEach method of outter test suite.</description>
