Welcome to unit testing basics course. 

In this chapter lets see what is unit testing, why we need them, how it is different from other type of tests. We will also look at different types of code that we generally see in any application. And finally two major approaches when it comes to writing unit tests:   
* Test Oriented approach
* Test Driven approach

# 1. What is unit testing?
Unit testing is targeting small piece of code called unit and write tests to verify whether it is working as expected. 

For example, in an application, we might have a function/subroutine to perform a particular task. We can refer to this function/subroutine as unit. The tests we write to verify whether the function/subroutine works as expected or not are called unit tests.

> **Note:** Unit is loosely defined term and subjective. In most cases you can refer a function/subroutine as unit and depending on the size, complexity and branches available in the function/subroutine,you might write several tests to cover all the scenarios.
